	  <h2>How do I use Google Tilt Brush?</h2>
      <p id="paragraph2">Users are presented with a virtual palette hovering above the hand controller from which they can select from a variety of brush types, colors, effects, and tools to paint their virtual creations. Movement of the handheld controller, using an intuitive interface in 3D space, creates brush strokes that follow in the virtual environment. With Dynamic Brushes ranging from ink and smoke to snow and fire, you can explore the wonders of a virtual palette. You can also capture snapshots, animated <abbr title="Graphic Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images, .<abbr title="Moving Picture Experts Group">mpeg</abbr> videos, or render 360 degree videos.

	  <h2>How much does the Tilt Brush cost?</h2>
      <p>The Oculus version of Tilt Brush is $30, and the Vive HTC version is similiar. Google has released a free set of tools to help developers transform Tilt Brush sketches into immersive 3D video animations. The company recently released the Tilt Brush 3D sketch program and is testing the tech with dozens of established artists via its 'Tilt Artists in Residence' program.

      <h2>How was the Tilt Brush developed?</h2>
	  <p>Tilt Brush was developed by Skillman & Hackett in 2014. It was nominated for four Proto Awards (namely: "Best Interaction Design", "Most Innovative", "Best Overall Virtual Reality Application", and "Best GUI"), of which it won the "Best <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>" award. Google acquired Tilt Brush in 2015. Tilt Brush was released for the HTC Vive virtual reality goggles at its launch on April 5, 2016, at no cost when pre-ordering the HTC Vive. On February 24, 2017, Tilt <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> announced it is now available on both Oculus Rift and Vive.

	  In a <em>Fast Company</em> article about Tilt Brush, one of the creators said that the idea of drawing in 3D space came from a chess game prototype: <q>There was a happy accident. Tilt Brush came out of an experiment with a virtual reality chess prototype, where we accidentally started painting the chess pieces in the air, and it was incredible!</q>.

	  <h2>Reception by the Media</h2>
      <p><em>Ars Technica</em> and other sites referred to Tilt Brush as the HTC Vive's killer app, praising the program's intuitive interface and the excitement of painting in three dimensions. Edward Baig of <b>USA Today</b> said that the program was the only one that excited him in the platform's launch lineup. Chris Suellentrop of <b>The New York Times</b> wrote that the program was well suited for beginners. In 2018, Tilt Brush was employed for the first time in mixed reality news reporting by the <b>NBC News</b> studio 'NBC Left Field'.
